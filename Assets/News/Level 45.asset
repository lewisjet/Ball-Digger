  text: 'hmm... I wonder what that hieroglyphic says...

    It looks like a warning
    for somthing beneath.

    We must go further.

    On our radars we''ve noticed
    a density change in emerald, it seems to now be up to 5 times stronger than previously.
    Also, the mineral we''ve named "Fools Bedrock" wont appear as much (thank God!).


    Good
    luck, mate.'
