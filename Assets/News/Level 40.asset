  text: 'Sorry about the last t..t..transmission.

    you s..s..see when the n..n..nuclear
    tanker w..w..went off

    it..it..it killed my mum.

    and thats why i''ve
    b..b..been so mean to you

    im sorry.

    Just to let you know, the blue
    EMP-emmiting crystals have been gave a name- elecirium.

    every crystal you
    break, the more damage ouccurs at the surface.

    There''s only 1 way of getting
    rid of the elecirim vein now:

    You have to destroy the CACHE around 60m down.

    thats
    all of the information I have for now.'
