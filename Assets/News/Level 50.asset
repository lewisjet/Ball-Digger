  text: 'We''ve translated the hieroglyphic, and it''s not good news...

    It states
    "WARNING, PROTECTION SYSTEM IN PLACE"

    And from our understanding there''s
    toxic gas clouds around the place.

    Luckily, 90% of the atmosphere is sutible
    for balls.

    However, 100% of the atmosphere is unsafe for humans-

    you
    will just have to look down the tunnel instead of being in the cockpit!

    hopefully,
    we should have protective gear for you by level 55.

    Good luck, soldier-
    you''ll need it!'
