  text: 'Good news mike: the protective gear is coming down in the self-building
    elavator shaft now!

    bad news, the next area is even more corrosive, even
    for your ball!

    In addition, those hyper-resistant Elecirium blocks have
    been named SENTRY NODES.

    You''ll be seeing much more of them, as well.

    When
    you get to the core, just break all of the Elecirium and then report back to
    Workshop.

    Oh and one last thing- the core sends out so many pulses that
    you won''t be able to control the digger properly!


    Good Luck Soldier
