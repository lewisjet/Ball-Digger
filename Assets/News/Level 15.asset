    ... Thank god you made it lower,
    it seems like you ran into multiple EMP hotspots in the last 10km into the ground.
    power at the surface is now at 30% thanks to your work. However, your wife, sally
    and billy and bobby will all be sad to hear that you won''t be coming back from
    work in a long, long time. keep exploring solider!

    We have detected a gas
    leak coming from a few KM down, you wont collide into the gas to break it, it''ll
    disperse itself. also, the ground''s going to get tougher. no more clay will
    be found and more 2HP granite will emerge.
