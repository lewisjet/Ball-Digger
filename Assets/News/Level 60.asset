  text: 'Wow, i''m in awe, soilder! you just single-handedly took down a threat to
    our planet!

    We noticed how there was an alien guarding the core- strange.

    We''ll
    look into that after your FINAL MISSION, however:

    you need to dump all of
    your accumulated elecirium into the planet''s core- not to be mistaked with the
    planetary tumor (the formal name for the EMP core) that you just destroyed!

    continue
    forth, soldier!


    You Are Unstoppable.'
